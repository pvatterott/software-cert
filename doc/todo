*Add more language functionality
   - int a = 3
   - break, continue
   - doubles
*Testing, testing testing
*Recursion 
*Finalize language support
  - Potentially limit to affine + comparisons
  - z = a * x;
    z = a / x;
    z = x - a;
    z = x + b;
    z = x + y;
    z = x < y;
    
    Remove bitwise, etc.

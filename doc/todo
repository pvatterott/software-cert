*Add more language functionality
   - break, continue
*Testing, testing testing
*Recursion 
*Finalize language support
  - Potentially limit to affine + comparisons
  - z = a * x;
    z = a / x;
    z = x - a;
    z = x + b;
    z = x + y;
    z = x < y;
    
    Remove bitwise, etc.

*Search for different examples

*registers.csv -> Descriptions of node types (int/float)

*Maintain Opcodes file

*Better Language Spec

*Multiple literal types in nodes file

Eliminate LT, GT

Double comparison => LT = LEQ, GT = GEQ
Int comparison => a + 1 <= b

Revert conditional expressions

Annotate variables with probable range
Specify default range at top of the file

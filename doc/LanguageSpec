Language Specification:

This document defines the restricted subset of the C programming language that
this verifier supports.

Declarations:

All the variables for a function should be declared at the top of a function.
The declarations can take the form:
  int a;
  double a, b;
  int a = 3, c = 4;
  
Assignments:
We support assignments of the form:
  a = X;
  a += X;
  a -= X;
  a *= X;
  a /= X;
  
Where X can be an identifier, a literal, or combinations of the two using parenthesis and operators
  
Operators:

In normal expressions, these are the operators allowed, in order of precedence:
< > <= >= == !=
+ -
* /


Control Flow:
We support the following control flow structures:

if (condition) {

} else {

}

while (condition) {

}

for (initializer; condition; update) {

}

In every control flow statement, conditions have two notable properties:
1) They can contain && and ||, which is not true of an assignment statement
2) They do not act as if there is short circuiting when verifying. Both conditions
   in an && or || statement will always be evaluated.
   
In for statements, the initializer and update rules should be normal assignment statements.


Postfix/Prefix:
Postfix/prefix (i++, ++i) are not currently supported



Functions:

This language supports function definitions and calls that are non-recursive and in the same file.
Function definitions are of the form:

int foo(int a, double b) {

}

Functions do not need to be declared above where they are used.

Literals:

Currently only support literals in decimal format
